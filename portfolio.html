          <h3>Role</h3>
          <p><b>First Author</b> <br>The idea of a physical examination was first generated by me and details were further developed with my group.</p>
          <p><b>User Research and Testing</b> <br>I consistently attended each round of user research and testing, actively talking to passers-by and inviting people to participate. I analyzed and visualized most data,constantly came up with different ways of improvement.
</p>
<p><b>Initial Prototyping</b><br> I did two rounds of intial protytyping by sketch on paper and put into POP for testing. As a group we drew out the wireframe of final prototype and further developed by Sina.</p>

        <h4><br>Important Design Decisions</h4>
        <p><b>Video Consultation</b><br>
As a group we went through several times of discussion about if we needed more function in our app such as online video consultation and personal profile. There are pros and cons. Have more function can provide users a more comprehensive experience, however, we came to agreement that mobile app is too small in size for a proper video consultation. Moreover, we wanted to focus on the booking system and review of the results at this stage.
<br><b>Camera</b><br>
Identity authentication was a important part of this service in order to provide reliable and trustworthy health report. We have different opinions about the camera placement. Initially, we were using facial recognition on users’ mobile phone to unlock the door. However, users could potential unlock the door miles away from the van. Therefore, we ended up placing the camera on the van. Considering public privacy, we added the confirmation of arrival button to turn on the camera only when users arrives at the van.<br>
<b>Paging</b><br>
An significant finding in the early testing stage was that app design if quite different from websites, it only holds and display certain amount of information on one page. Overloading the screen distracts users’ attention, moreover, making the whole process unclear. We spent a lot of time working on what elements go onto what pages, so that it is easy to follow through.

        <h3>Reflection</h3>

    </div>

    <div class="row">
      <div class="col-md-12">
        <p>Personally, I feel our app would definitely solve the problem addressed. With Vannie aiding the online video consultation, the result would be more accurate. Later on, with this service, people are able to see a doctor without going to medical center, thus, a more accessible and less time consuming experience.<br>

As far as what we’ve done, the app has a minimalist design. However, it could have been looking more professional with more work done in improving the spacing and placement of each element.<br>

Next step would be exploring more functions which could be achieved in a mobile app, such as a user profile, which stores user information. Moreover, visualizing the changes in users’ body condition.
