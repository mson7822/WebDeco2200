                <p>Before the group assessment starts, we all did individual research report, focuses on using autonomous vehicles in the medical field. Tsu-en did her research on the emergency situation, Sina did her research on blood transfusion. ­</p>
                <p>
                My research was a bit broader, I looked into how the current medical service performed on a daily basis. I started research looking at the whole health care system, then looked into an online video consultation which is called ’telehealth’. Afterward, I started a user research. I went on doing interviews and surveys on how people felt about the medical service in general and tried to find out existing issues and possible improvement.</p>
                <p>Here are two interesting findings of the survey:</p>

                <p>Afterward, I did some interviews to find out the reason behind their behaviors, moreover, used Online Ethnography, where I collect reviews from health-related websites ­</p>
                <p>
                Here are the key findings:</p>
              <ul>
  <li>People tend to rest at home when they get sick rather than go to a medical center due to long waiting time
</li>
  <li>With the current procedure, people have to get medical certificate for a paid leave, however, there are people who just need to have a good rest for a day ended up having to spend time getting the medical certificate</li>
  <li>One significant drawback of telehealth is lacking physical examination</li>
  <li> It has been an issue for people who have chronic disease to get medicine every so often, the whole process they have to go through frequently is highly time- consuming
</li>
</ul>
<p>Summing up of the findings, the existing service is a bit unapproachable and considered to be highly time-consuming, the two significant issues are medication delivery and physical examination.</p>

                <p>After the previous studying. As a group we started going through each of our individual reports, looking at issues we research on and the key findings.</p>

<p>Tsu-en researched the emergency situation, she found that there are multiple reasons which caused a delay in the arrival of the ambulance, meanwhile, drones could get to the appointed position much faster. She also noted that, sometimes, people are too shocked in an emergency situation that they cannot react properly, for example, forgetting the emergency service number.</p>
<p>

Sina did her research specifically on blood transfusion, she found that the current blood transfusion system does not really record donors’ information. More importantly, the current blood delivery was not efficient enough, sometimes, the result of blood analysis could be affected by inappropriate storage on the way.</p>
<p>

Again, my report stated, the current medical service was unapproachable and highly time-consuming.</p>
<p>

As a group, we discussed all the issues and decided that we should start again and look at the whole situation in a broader angle. By doing this, we are able to come up with more ideas on how autonomous vehicles could be incorporated in the current medical system.  Autonomous vehicles were believed to be more efficient with less human resource required, and it was faster in some situations such as drones. We talked through each step a patient would go through from diagnosis, physical examination, getting medicine and hospitalization, and tried to find out what problems are there referring to our previous research. We brainstormed several ideas:
</p>
              <ul>
  <li><b>Medical Delivery</b> via drones, therefore users can get their medicine in a timely manner.
</li>
  <li><b>Physical Examination Van</b>, which is a self- examination van that goes to the user at appointed position and time.
</li>
  <li><b>Emergency Supply Drone</b>, a drone that transports medical equipment in an urgent situation. It not only arrives at the scene faster than an ambulance, but the camera on the drone could also be used to pass back video information of the patient’s condition.
</li>
  <li><b>In-hospital Medication Delivery</b>, a small automatic car that is mainly responsible for transporting drugs or injections. This may increase efficiency and save time for doctors/ nurses to take things.

</li>
  <li><b>Mobile Infusion Stand</b>, the patient can walk around with this even when they are alone having an infusion.

</li>
</ul>

                <h3>week 7 Idea Elimination and development</h3>
              </div>

            <div class="row">
              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>We had a group meeting at the beginning of the week, discussed the pros and cons of each idea and eliminated a few so we have two concepts to focus on.
We firstly eliminated the idea of mobile infusion stand and emergency supply drones. Mobile infusion stand had very limited functions that we can further develop into an app. With previous research, as a group, we sent out research invitation and only got one reply. We interviewed a professor from our university medical center. He thought using drones was definitely faster, and somehow efficient, however, that was also a lot of limitation to this concept. Drones could be used to deliver medicine and medical equipment. However, without the diagnosis, it is hard to determine what medicine to send. Even for a patient who had a chronic disease, it might not always be the case. Sending the wrong medicine could lead to a serious consequence. Sending equipment is more feasible in a way, however, there has to be someone confident and familiar with the use of equipment. With all these stated constraints to the concepts, we decided to eliminate them.  With the in-hospital delivery, we found it very difficult to get in touch with people having the knowledge for what to include in an app like that. Therefore, we decided to develop further into what we could be used on a daily basis and the aim was to provide users with a more accessible and efficient health service incorporating the use of autonomous vehicles.</p>
<p>


Later in the week, each of us drew out storyboards for the proposed service. Tzu-en did a storyboard for emergency drone before we found out there were limited functions to develop. Sina drew a storyboard for the medical delivery drone and I did a storyboard for the physical examination van, which was later named Vannie.
</p>
<div class="col-md-12">

<p></p>

<p>
This is my storyboard. I decided to out a story of a person getting his medical certificate, which relates back to my previous research. Moreover, I thought drawing out a daily basis check and drawing out the experience of a patient who has chronic disease did not have as much plot to it. Moreover, even though I research a lot on telehealth, I was not confident with getting all the steps right for a video consultation. After all, I really wanted to focus on, what functions are there, and drew out the main screen we will need in the Vannie app.

When we were in class, we explored existing logos in the medical field, and then pick and design a logo for Vannie. In addition, we also planned out the whole process and made an evaluation plan.</p>

                <p>After storyboards are drawn, the concept of the emergency drone was completely eliminated. Therefore, we only had two concepts left. One, the medical delivery drone and the physical examination van. As a group, we briefly discussed what main functions should be included, did a quick simple roleplay.
                </p>
<p>Afterward, Sina and I went on sketching out very rough copies of what screens are there for both apps. We did it in our own time without looking at each other’s work, so we could really have our own thinking implemented in our design. We did end up having different functions and layout, which was a really good outcome as we expected. Tsu-en then picked and chose the ‘good’ screens from the sketches, and pulled it all together into POP for the first round of testing.</p>
<p>On Thursday, we did our first round of testing. With screens picked from different sets of design, the first prototype we had was extremely inconsistent in both style and layout.

              <div class="col-md-12">
                <p>Drone:</p>

                <ul>
                <li>The home page was overloaded with all sorts of information</li><li>In the product detail page, the photo of the product was too small, the add to cart button was a bit unclear</li>
                <li>The automated order caused confusion</li>
                <li>Given feedback that the payment screens were really straightforward and easy to follow through</li>
                <li>The interface
after the arrival of the drone is not sufficient, and the user seems a little bit confused about
what to do next.</li>
                </ul>
                </div>

                <p>After the first round of testing, I realized for a mobile app, it has a very different layout comparing to a website. The screen size is much smaller, sometimes, tasks should be divided up to more screens, so there is only one step to focus on at a time. Based on the feedback, we also added in a screen to show the status, so the user could keep track of their order.</p>

                 <p>Vannie:</p>
                <ul>
                <li> The sign-up and uploading id page seemed confusing, and the button did not seem clickable</li>
                <li>Some wording did not make sense to users</li>
                <li>Users were not able to review their order</li>
                <li> Some functions such as locking the van and scanning face to unlock were questionable.
</li>

                </ul>
                <p>After the testing was done, I realized it was really important to allow users to review their order and their selection. Moreover, we really needed to work on our wording of the buttons so it would not cause confusion. A self-examination van was a proposed service, users have no idea what is going to happen, it was really important that they understand each screen so they can really interact with the app without guidance. After all, we added in review pages and also made some change to the wording and the look the buttons.</p>

                <h3>Week 9 Second Round of User testing</h3>
              </div>
            </div>

            <p>We sat together to really alter things based on the previous testing and discussed the placement of buttons, the whole layout, and style.</p>
            <p>

We drew more carefully together to make our Low-fidelity paper prototype, which was our second iteration, also pulled together in POP. And then, we started our second round of testing.
</p>

                <p>Drone:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Users were still confused with the function of regular order
</li><li>There was still confusion with having both ‘-’, ‘+’ and the ‘add’ button.
</li>
                <li>Some of the steps was too sudden, users suggested a second round of confirmation pop up
</li>
                </ul>
<div><p></p></div>



                               <p>Vannie:</p>
                                <p>Users were able to process through very well after the changes made up to this stage, the major problem would be looking into the aesthetic of screens and we also found a real-life constraint with the parking issue. Users have recommended having the app allocating the closest pick-up point and parking place.</p>
                                <p>


During these two rounds of testing, we have also interviewed users’ opinion on how they feel about these two concepts, and we ended up with further developing Vannie. Vannie is more innovative, we have really looked into the functions needed and it is a service which people really looked forward to using. Medical delivery drones are very useful when people urgently need some sorts of medication, otherwise, this service was very similar to online shopping but faster. However, there was the law which limited the delivery of prescription medication.</p>
<p>


After two rounds of testing, Sina was in charge of making the wireframe, Tsu-en and I started writing done the evaluation and changes made in the report. Meanwhile, I made a flowchart for Vannie’s paper prototype.

                <h3>Week 10 Final Prototyping</h3>
              </div>
            </div>
            <p>The wireframe was done in the weekend, we had a group discussion, altered things slightly to put it into Invision.</p>
            <p>

For the wireframe, we added in a loading page, therefore, users don’t go straight into the sign-up page. We also added in a lot of description buttons for better understanding. For identity checking, we have moved the face scanning function onto the van itself so the results are more reliable through identity authentication.</p>
<p>

We did the third round of testing.</p>
<ul>
<li>Time selection was not clear enough</li>
<li>User suggested we should provide some kind of sets so that it is easier for people who have no idea what kind of checking components are needed.</li>
<li>A user spotted there was no confirmation message before the van’s arrival.</li>
</ul>

<p>After assignment 2 was done, we are happy with the functions we had and paid more attention to the aesthetic of the app. As a group, we noted what has to be changed and Sina went on and did the final prototype in Invision.</p>
<p>

We did the fourth round of testing and found that a clearer instruction might be needed for face scanning, therefore I suggested to add in an icon showing where the camera would be.</p>

<p>After all the changes are made, Sina and I together made the prototype walkthought video.I then went on evaluate more based on the previous feedback and using the 10 Usability Heuristics as a guideline, I have concluded what we have done well and what could be improved in the future.</p>
